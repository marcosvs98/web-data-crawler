This repository contains a comprehensive solution for content analysis, extraction, and processing. The subsystems within this project work together to provide an efficient and flexible solution, enabling simplified extraction of valuable information from various data sources.


### Parser

The parser subsystem uses simple algorithms to split the input string based on a provided separator. While the specific implementation may vary in different programming languages, the core idea is to create a function or method that divides the string into different sections.

Upon identifying the separator in the input string, the parsing mechanism performs the splitting process. It creates a data structure, such as a tuple, that contains the following parts:

1. The portion of the string that comes before the separator.
2. The separator itself.
3. The portion of the string that comes after the separator.

These parts can be accessed and used separately as needed to perform other operations or analyses.

Concrete objects implement a fluent interface, which allows for method chaining to perform sequential operations. This approach is often referred to as "method cascading," where each method returns the object itself (typically named `self` by convention), enabling the next method call to be applied to the resulting object. This fluent interface approach facilitates the passing of execution context between subsequent method calls.

In summary, the parser subsystem implements the functionality of splitting the input string based on a separator and provides a fluent interface for performing subsequent operations with the resulting split data.

### Static Parser
The static parser is a mechanism that enables the extraction and analysis of content blocks or analysis within the same block. The structure of the parser aims to simplify the analyzed area by simply cutting out the main content.


Certainly! Based on the provided class `StaticTextParser`, here are some additional details you can include:

1. **Functionality**: The `StaticTextParser` is designed to perform static tag parsing, extracting content between specified start and end tokens.

2. **Tag Configuration**: The parser supports the configuration of tags through the `parameters` attribute. Each parameter represents a tag and consists of a name, start tag, and optional end tag.

3. **Tag Matching**: During parsing, the parser iterates through the defined parameters to find a match for the given `tag_name`. It compares the `tag_name` with the names of the parameters to identify the relevant tag for extraction.

4. **Tag Replacement**: The parser allows for optional replacement of tag values through the `replace_map` parameter. This enables the modification of tag values before matching and extraction.

5. **Error Handling**: The parser performs error handling to ensure robust parsing. It checks for the presence of start and end tokens, and if they are not found, appropriate exceptions (`StartTokenNotFoundParserException` and `EndTokenNotFoundParserException`) are raised. If the specified tag is not found, a `TagNotFoundParserException` is raised.

6. **Extraction Process**: Once a matching tag is found, the parser extracts the content between the start and end tokens. It determines the content's location within the `content` attribute by partitioning the `content_upper` attribute based on the start and end tokens. The extracted content is stored in the `field` attribute (both uppercase and original case versions).

### Sequential Parser

The sequential parser is a mechanism that enables the extraction and analysis of content while maintaining the last position of the analyzed content as a block and removing the already extracted portion from further analysis.

This parser allows for the analysis of multiple occurrences of a content by searching for a specific tag in a sequential manner.

Here are more details about the sequential parser based on the `SequentialTextParser` class:

The `SequentialTextParser` class represents a text parser that sequentially searches for tags and extracts content between specified start and end tokens.

**Functionality:** The parser iterates through the defined parameters to find a match for the given `tag_name`. It compares the `tag_name` with the names of the parameters to identify the relevant tag for extraction.

**Tag Replacement:** Similar to the static parser, the sequential parser also supports optional replacement of tag values through the `replace_map` parameter. This allows for the modification of tag values before matching and extraction.

**Error Handling:** The parser includes error handling to ensure robust parsing. It checks for the presence of start and end tokens and raises appropriate exceptions (`StartTokenNotFoundParserException` and `EndTokenNotFoundParserException`) if they are not found. If the specified tag is not found, a `TagNotFoundParserException` is raised.

**Extraction Process:** Once a matching tag is found, the parser extracts the content between the start and end tokens. It uses the `cursor_upper` attribute to keep track of the remaining content. The extracted content is stored in the `field` attribute (both uppercase and original case versions).

**Cursor Manipulation:** After successful extraction, the parser updates the `cursor_upper` and `cursor` attributes to represent the remaining content that needs to be parsed. The `cursor` attribute holds the original case content, while `cursor_upper` holds the uppercase version.

These details provide a comprehensive overview of the functionality and behavior of the `SequentialTextParser` class .

### Filtering and Formatting

The Filtering and Formatting subsystem is based on the behavior of a responsibility chain, allowing multiple filters and formatters to handle content without tight coupling. By chaining filters and formatters, we enable the appropriate treatment for specific occasions or content requirements.

This subsystem facilitates the traversal and processing of content through a recursive approach, ensuring the input-output flow within a single pipeline that can accommodate multiple handlers.

Key Features of the Filtering and Formatting Subsystem:

1. Responsibility Chain: The subsystem employs a responsibility chain pattern, where each filter or formatter in the chain has the opportunity to handle the content based on its specific logic or rules.

2. Decoupled Treatments: By decoupling the treatments, the subsystem promotes modular and flexible design. Each filter or formatter operates independently, focusing on its specialized task while remaining unaware of other filters or formatters in the chain.

3. Recursive Traversal: The subsystem supports recursive traversal of the content pipeline, allowing for in-depth processing and transformation. This enables the application of different filters and formatters in a specific order, based on the type of content and the desired outcome.

4. Single Pipeline Processing: The content flows through a unified pipeline, ensuring a streamlined and efficient processing flow. The pipeline can accommodate multiple handlers, facilitating the seamless execution of various filtering and formatting operations.

The Filtering and Formatting subsystem enhances the overall functionality and versatility of the system by providing a modular and extensible approach to content treatment. It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by allowing new filters and formatters to be easily added to the responsibility chain when required.


#### Functioning of the Structure
The derived handler classes know how to filter or format the provided content. If the "current" handler is not available or sufficient, it delegates the task to the base class, which, in turn, delegates it to the "next" handler, creating a continuous cycle.

The Filtering and Formatting subsystem is wrapped by a Builder, which is responsible for grouping and executing the filter chaining. This allows for the implementation of various filters with pre-defined sequences.

### Syntax Content Analysis

The Syntax Content Analysis provides interfaces for creating families of objects of type `ContentParser` that are related or dependent without specifying their concrete classes.

In syntax content analysis, we define compatible parsers to extract business-relevant data. These parsers allow us to identify the specific area where the desired data is located. The data is observed in a generic manner, regardless of the structural type, such as HTML, XML, or JSON.

Once the target area is identified, it is necessary to evaluate the ideal template that indicates how the parser should be applied. With the ideal template, we can process the obtained content, analyze it using sub-templates, and extract raw content.

Once the data group containing the desired values is identified, we can perform static and sequential analyses without relying on the inferred data type in the pipeline.

By using this approach, we achieve flexibility and reusability in handling various types of syntax content, enabling effective extraction of valuable information from different data sources.
